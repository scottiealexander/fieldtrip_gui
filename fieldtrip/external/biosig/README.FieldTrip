The directory fieldtrip/external/biosig contains a selection of the
Biosig functions that are used by FielTrip functions. All BioSig
functions that are not directly called by FieldTrip have been moved
to the biosig/private directory to ensure that they do not interfere
with normal MATLAB and FieldTrip operation.

The version here corresponds to Biosig 2.61 and was downloaded on
10 March 2012 from http://biosig.sourceforge.net.

See the file COPYING for the Biosig copyrights.
