function SP=sap2matlab(blob)

% SAP2MATLAB parses Siemens ASCII protocol data and generates a 
% corresponding MATLAB data structure.
%
% Use as
%   SP = sap2matlab(blob)
%
% where 'blob' needs to be of type uint8 or char. This function
% is currently used for de-serialising the header information
% from a FieldTrip buffer containing fMRI data from a Siemens
% scanner.
